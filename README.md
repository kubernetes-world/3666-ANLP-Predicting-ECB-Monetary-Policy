# Summary of the project:

Objective: Create a model to predict the direction on monetary policy changes based on European Central Bank (ECB) press releases and speeches. ECB generally meets every 6 weeks for monetary policy decisions

Dataset: Retrieved all English press releases and speeches from the ECB website from 1999 to present.
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robertolofaro/ecb-speeches-1997-to-20191122-frequencies-dm

Challenges: Highly imbalanced dataset that had significantly more articles that led to no change in interest rates as compared to those that preceded an interest rate increase or decrease

Use case examples:
	•	Optimize investment strategy and portfolio management (eg.  asset allocation)
	•	Better risk management (eg. minimize the cost of interest rate hedging)
	•	Corporate treasury management (eg. lower borrowing costs)
	•	Sovereign debt analysis and FX/currency trading and hedging

Files contain multiple notebooks of exploratory data analysis,various models trained and tested, as well as a presentation deck that summarizes the project and findings

Models:
Logistic regression
Tree search
LSTM with SMOTE
BERT (this notebook contains EDA)
